# AMR Software

The robot software is a single C++ executable.

In the future I might make a ROS2 repository that uses the same components, but for now I want this project to be independent from ROS so it can be more easily debugged and tested. I also want to experiment with different software architectures since I have a fair amount of ROS experience already.
